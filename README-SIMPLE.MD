# PowerShell Script for Access Package Builder - Creating Access Packages Automatically

First, a big shout out to Nico Wyss for creating the Access Package Builder tool and inviting me to contribute to this project!

## What is the Access Package Builder?

The [Access Package Builder](https://accesspackagebuilder.azurewebsites.net) is a tool that helps organizations manage access rights more efficiently. If you're wondering "what does that actually mean?" - let me explain with a simple example:

Imagine you have a new employee joining your Human Resources department. This person needs access to multiple applications and systems to do their job. Instead of manually granting access to each system individually (which can be time-consuming and error-prone), Access Packages in Microsoft Entra ID Governance let you bundle all necessary access rights together and assign them in one go.

## The Challenge

While Access Packages are helpful, figuring out which resources should be bundled together can be challenging when you have thousands of security groups and hundreds of departments. This is where the Access Package Builder comes in - it analyzes your existing setup and recommends logical groupings of resources.

## How Our PowerShell Script Helps

Once the Access Package Builder has recommended which resources should be grouped together, you have two options:
1. Create these packages manually (potentially time-consuming)
2. Use our PowerShell script to create them automatically

Our script takes the recommendations from the Access Package Builder and creates all the necessary packages in your system with minimal effort on your part.

## Using the PowerShell Script - Step by Step

### What You'll Need:
- A JSON file from the Access Package Builder containing the recommendations
- Your Tenant ID (a unique identifier for your organization)
- Basic familiarity with running PowerShell scripts

### The Process:

1. **Download Your JSON File**: Visit [Access Package Builder](https://accesspackagebuilder.azurewebsites.net/builder) and download your recommendations as a JSON file.

2. **Run the Script**: When you run the script, it will ask for:
   - The path to your JSON file (e.g., "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\access-packages.json")
   - Your Tenant ID (found in your Microsoft Entra admin center)

3. **Review and Confirm**: The script will show you what packages it's going to create and which groups will be added to each package. You'll have a chance to review before any changes are made.

4. **Automatic Creation**: After confirmation, the script will:
   - Create three catalogs if they don't already exist: Default, Company, and Department
   - Create the recommended access packages in these catalogs
   - Add default policies that control how these packages can be assigned
   - Add the appropriate security groups to each package

5. **Group Compatibility Check**: The script automatically checks if each security group can be added to an access package. Some types of groups (like distribution lists or dynamic groups) aren't compatible, and the script will let you know if it encounters any of these.

## Technical Details (For Those Interested)

The script handles several important tasks:
- Creating catalogs to organize your access packages
- Creating the access packages themselves
- Setting up default policies that determine who can request access
- Setting up auto-assignment policies that can automatically grant access based on user attributes
- Adding compatible security groups to your packages

Each step has built-in error handling to ensure the process runs smoothly.

## The Result

After running the script, you'll have a well-organized set of access packages that align with your organizational structure. This makes it much easier to manage access rights, onboard new employees, or transfer existing employees between departments.

The best part? What might have taken days of manual configuration can be accomplished in minutes with our automated approach.
